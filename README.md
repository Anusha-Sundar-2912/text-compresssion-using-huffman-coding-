Text Compression and Decompression Web Application
Overview:

This web application facilitates the compression and decompression of text files (.txt) using Huffman Coding, a technique for lossless data compression. Huffman Coding assigns variable-length codes to different 
characters based on their frequency of occurrence in the text. Characters with higher frequency are assigned shorter codes, leading to efficient compression.
Features:

    Lossless Compression: The compression process retains all the original data without loss.
    Interactive Interface: Built using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, the application provides a user-friendly and responsive interface.
    Automatic File Download: After compression or decompression, the processed file is automatically downloaded.
    Compression Ratio Display: Shows the compression ratio achieved during compression.
    Info Page: Offers detailed information about the technique of Lossless Data Compression with Huffman coding.

Usage:

    Landing Page: Navigate to the landing page where you can initiate the compression or decompression process.

    Upload File: Choose the text file you want to compress or decompress.

    Select Action: Specify whether you want to compress or decompress the file.
